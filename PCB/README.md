These are the files for the circuit board, designed in KiCAD 5.0.2. There are a couple of custom libraries that I made for the Anderson PowerPole right-angle connectors and the fuse holders, but they should be included here. 

Note that there are two parallel versions of many of the fust check components - this lets you build the board using either through-hole or surface-mount components, but I recommend the through-hole components if you're building the boards as one-offs.
